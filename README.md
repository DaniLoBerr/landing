# We show you Asturias

This project consists of creating a landing page for a tourist guide company in the Asturias region of Spain.

With a given design, the aim of this project is to practice the basics of CSS and Flexbox learned in the "Foundations" module of The Odin Project's web curriculum, as well as to review the basics of GIT and HTML.
